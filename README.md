üìå Project Title: PACMAN in MASM Assembly
Course: Computer Organization / Assembly Language Programming
Student: Muhammad Ammar Shahid
Roll Number: 23i-2125
Semester: 2nd
University: FAST-NUCES, Islamabad

üìÅ Project Structure
File Name	Description
23i-2125.asm	Main source file written in MASM Assembly. Contains the complete logic for score input, validation, processing, and writing to output.
myScore.txt	Output file generated by the program. Stores scores entered or calculated.
23i-2125.mp4	A demonstration video of the program execution. Showcases interface, input/output flow, and overall functionality.

üß† Project Objective
This project aims to demonstrate low-level programming using MASM (Microsoft Macro Assembler). It focuses on input/output operations, file handling, data validation, and interaction with users through console-based prompts ‚Äî all implemented in x86 Assembly using the Irvine32 library.

The main learning outcomes include:

Understanding and manipulating memory in assembly.

Performing file input/output operations.

Processing and validating numerical data.

Strengthening understanding of control flow in Assembly.

üèóÔ∏è Features
Prompt-based input of scores (e.g., from user or predefined values).

Validates if the score is within acceptable range.

Outputs results into a text file myScore.txt.

Demonstration video for visualization and explanation.

üßæ Technologies Used
Language: Assembly (MASM x86)

Assembler: MASM with Irvine32.inc support

Tools: Visual Studio / DOSBox / MASM32 SDK

Output Format: Plain text and video

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Project
Requirements:
MASM environment (Visual Studio + Irvine32 library or MASM32 SDK)

Windows Operating System

Steps:
Open Visual Studio or MASM-compatible IDE.

Place the 23i-2125.asm file in the source folder.

Ensure that Irvine32.inc, kernel32.lib, and other dependencies are correctly linked.

Build and run the project.

The program will prompt you to enter scores (numeric input).

Output will be saved to myScore.txt.

You can watch 23i-2125.mp4 to see the program in action.

üîç Internal Logic Overview
Uses Irvine32 library functions for I/O operations.

Implements conditional jumps and loops for data validation.

Writes user inputs to a text file using file-writing system calls.

Displays output both on the console and writes it persistently to myScore.txt.

üéì Educational Value
This project helps students grasp:

The complexity and precision required in low-level programming.

How memory and registers interact with user input/output.

Practical file handling in an environment without high-level abstraction.

Debugging techniques specific to Assembly.

üìπ Video Walkthrough (Optional)
The file 23i-2125.mp4 is a brief demo of how the project behaves at runtime. It includes:

Launching the program.

Entering scores.

Demonstrating correct and incorrect inputs.

Viewing the generated output file.

üì¢ Notes
The program is designed for learning and demonstration purposes.

Make sure your MASM setup includes the Irvine32 library before running.

You can edit the source code to extend functionalities like:

Calculating average scores.

Adding player names.

Sorting scores before writing to file.
